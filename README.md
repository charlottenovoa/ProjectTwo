# DES 228 Project Two 

By: Charlotte Novoa

# project overview

For this project on community I wanted to chose a song that reminded of my family and what community is to me. The song I landed on was "Don't Stop Believin'" By Journey. I chose this song because it is played at Giants games during the 7th inning stretch. It makes me think of the memories I have at AT&T (not Oracle) Park with my family, friends and city as a whole. 

# technical overview

This project uses HTML and CSS to create a visual experience based on my memories associated with the song I chose. The animations are baseball themed and use the San Francisco Giants' team colors as that is what the song reminds me of.
